# javachat
A simple socket based chat application made using java

TODO

pass host from hostField to ClientMain (implement ClientMain receiving this too)
add label to connection scene for errors connecting to host
Make everything threadsafe (nothing is threadsafe currently)
Ensure client socket is closed when user wants to end session / exit
disconnect button
unique chatrooms on the same server (so that user can only see messages in the chatroom they are connected to)
